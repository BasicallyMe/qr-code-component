## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS stylesheet

### What I learned

It was fun working on this challenge. One major thing I learned was to keep it simple without overstyling the elements too much. Learned about a new CSS property value `fit-content` for the height and width property. Also `inherit` value for different properties like border-radius, padding etc.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  max-height: 100%;
  border-radius: inherit;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about CSS properties and using HTML markup correctly.
